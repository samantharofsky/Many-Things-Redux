In this project I learned and focused on using loops. I became more comfortable with using them, writing them, and understanding how they worked. In the initial version of this project, the squares changed speeds when different numbers were pressed. However, when the speeds would change, the squares seemed to all stay together in a clump instead of spreading out. When looking over this project, I realized that I can fix that by cahnging the speed from one specific number to a range of numbers and use random() to let the computer decide at which speed each individual square would move.
